# Hello

Hello everybody!

I am bachelor student from the netherlands. 
I have a heavy interest in program analysis from x86 to functional programming. 
This is my blog about mostly my research that I've done in my spare-time.

Feel free to contact me for questions and discussions at: sebpeters@outlook.com
