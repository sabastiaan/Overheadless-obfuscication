The build instructions for FoxDec state you should adhoc search for the packages to be installed, this took me quite a bit of time so here I did it for you.

```

apt install haskell cabal z3
cabal install containers Unique GraphSCC z3 parsec3-numbers parsec-numbers bitwise bits random argparser
```
enjoy!
